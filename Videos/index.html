<h3>Game like research software</h3>

This software is develop for ball catching experiment. Main research questions are: 1. Is there difference between first and 
third person views? 2. Does narrowed field of view affect on performance?

<h3>Excell Spreadsheet data</h3>

In this experiment, I read normal Excel csv-file and made three different visualizations. On the left there is 3D lines, on front 3D 
bar charts, and on right parallel bar charts. Colormap is one of Cynthia Brewer's Colorbrew colormaps.

position and rotation. While user keeps trigger pulled, application use difference between controller's current position and rotation 
values and reference to transform camera. Movement and rotation stop, when user releases the trigger.
